### Planting Science

Planting Science is a program run by the Education branch of the Botanical Society of America that aims to put supplies and currcicula for running plant science experiments in classrooms all over the US. Via an online platform, PS connects scientist mentors and teachers so that students in middle and high schools have guidance through the duration of the project. I have been with PS since 2021, serving as mentor to students, and as liaison between scientist mentors and teachers. It presents a unique opportunity to connect with teachers in public schools who want to make experimental plant science part of their plan for the school year. You can check out the Planting Science website [**here**](https://plantingscience.org/).
