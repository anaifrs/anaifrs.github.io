### Teaching (Assistant) Experience 

As a graduate student I was a teaching assistant in the Botany department, now part of the School of Life Sciences, of University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. I have experience teaching undergraduate labs that involved skill-building, cooperative activities, and experimentation, including:

  Plant Form and Function (plant anatomy and physiology skills and experimentation) 
  
  Plants, People, Culture (covering elements of ethnobotany)
  
  Marine Ecology and Evolution (covering general ecological concepts and experimentation)
